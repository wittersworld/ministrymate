App for Jehovah's Witnesses to track their field service reports

This is the same app that has been available on Windows Phone since 2010, but it is being updated to target the latest versions of the platform.  It is also being developed as a web-based application, allowing users to access their data anywhere they have an internet connection.  Eventually, we plan to also develop versions for Android and iOS.

The app is now open-source to allow the community to drive features and contribute to its development.
